the ItemPrefabs prefab in this directory contains all the "Assets" we want to use.
they are named specifically and referenced in code to associate dodi's to models.

make sure you.

1. name any new models correctly following convention
2. add the models to any mappings required e.g. switch blocks
3. set them to "not receive shadows"
4. reflection probes set to "simple"
5. add a "Mesh Collider" component to the model (otherwise you won't be able to highlight it and you can run through it)
