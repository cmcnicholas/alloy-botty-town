# Botty Town

Botty Town is an experiment using the Alloy API and Unity to deliver a 3D gameworld backed by real data in alloy with synchronisation of data in the game world.

Complete inspections and jobs to gain points and have them closed in Alloy. Register defects that appear in the game world and have them reported in Alloy.
